# Tidy Tuesday in Thirty

Repository for .Rmd files where I work with Tidy Tuesday data. I only spend thirty minutes with each file (and maybe a little bit of time after). I record unedited videos of me doing the coding, so they are full of ums and ers but hopefully also good tidbits of R code. You can follow the YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyEH7o09I464lt0JBNqchKo6dxWD8W8rr), too.
