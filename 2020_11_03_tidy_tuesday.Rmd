This week's data is all about IKEA furniture.

### Code I worked on during the 30 minute screencast

Summary of numeric variables

```{r}
ikea %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), 
                   list(mean, min, max),
                   na.rm = TRUE))
```


Final graph from video (added the part where I saved the graph).

```{r}
ikea_smry <- ikea %>% 
  group_by(category) %>% 
  summarize(med_price = median(price))

ikea_price_graph <- 
  ikea %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, 
             y = fct_reorder(category, price, median))) +
  geom_jitter(size = .5,
              alpha = .3, 
              height = .2,
              color = "gold2") +
  geom_point(data = ikea_smry,
             aes(x = med_price, y = category),
             color = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "IKEA furniture prices (Saudi Riyals)",
       x = "",
       y = "") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray94"),
        plot.title.position = "plot")

ikea_price_graph

# ggsave("ikea_price.png", ikea_price_graph)
```

### Code after 30 minutes screencast

I wanted to do a couple small things before calling it quits. Truthfully, there's a lot more I'd want to do, but I'm forcing myself not to spend too much more time, otherwise I'm not fairly representing what I can do in ~30 minutes.

* Change size of font on x-axis so you could see all the numbers  
* Change size of median dots.

* Label what the points are more clearly.


```{r}
ikea_price_graph_final <- 
  ikea %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = price, 
             y = fct_reorder(category, price, median))) +
  geom_jitter(size = .5,
              alpha = .3, 
              height = .2,
              color = "gold2") +
  geom_point(data = ikea_smry,
             aes(x = med_price, y = category),
             color = "darkblue",
             size = .7) +
  labs(title = "IKEA Furniture",
       subtitle = "<span style='color:gold2'>Actual</span> and 
    <span style='color:darkblue'>Median</span> Prices (Saudi Riyals)",
       x = "",
       y = "") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray94"),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.subtitle = element_markdown(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 4))

ikea_price_graph_final

ggsave("ikea_price_final.png", ikea_price_graph_final)
```
